          <h5>Privacy Policy</h5>
          <p>
            Start My Diet knows that you care how information about you is used
            and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so
            carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. By
            visiting startmydiet.com, you are accepting the practices described
            in this privacy notice.

            What personal information about customers does startmydiet.com
            gather?
          </h5>
          <p>
            The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and
            continually improve your shopping experience at startmydiet.com.
            Here are the types of information we gather. Information You Give
            Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site
            or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain
            information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of
            many of our features. We use the information that you provide for
            such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future
            shopping for you, improving our store, and communicating with you.
            Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of
            information whenever you interact with us. E-mail Communications: To
            help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a
            confirmation when you open e-mail from startmydiet.com if your
            computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer
            list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid
            sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to
            receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Email
            Communication Preferences. Information from Other Sources: We may
            receive information about you from other sources.
          </p>
          <h5> Does startmydiet.com share the information it receives? </h5>
          <p>
            Information about our customers is an important part of our
            business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We
            share customer information only as described below and potentially
            with subsidiaries of startmydiet.com. Agents: We employ other
            companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.
            Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending
            postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from
            customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance,
            processing credit card payments, and providing customer service.
            They have access to personal information needed to perform their
            functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Promotional
            Offers: Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of
            startmydiet.com customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do
            this, we do not give that business your name and address. Business
            Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or
            buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions,
            customer information generally is one of the transferred business
            assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing
            Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise).
            Also, in the unlikely event that startmydiet.com, or substantially
            all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course
            be one of the transferred assets. Protection of startmydiet.com and
            Others: We release account and other personal information when we
            believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or
            apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the
            rights, property, or safety of startmydiet.com, our users, or
            others. This includes exchanging information with other companies
            and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
            Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing,
            or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from
            customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments
            set forth in this Privacy Notice. With Your Consent: Other than as
            set out above, you will receive notice when information about you
            might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to
            choose not to share the information.
          </p>
          <h5>How Secure Is Information About Me?</h5>
          <p>
            We work to protect the security of your information during
            transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which
            encrypts information you input. We reveal only the last five digits
            of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we
            transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit
            card company during order processing. It is important for you to
            protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your
            computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.{" "}
          </p>
          <h5>Which Information Can I Access?</h5>
          <p>
            startmydiet.com gives you access to a broad range of information
            about your account and your interactions with startmydiet.com for
            the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that
            information.
          </p>
          <h5>What Choices Do I Have?</h5>
          <p>
            As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide
            information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase. You
            can add or update certain information on pages such as those listed
            in the "Which Information Can I Access?" section above. When you
            update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for
            our records. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from
            us, please adjust your Email Communication Preferences. (If you do
            not want to receive Conditions of Use and other legal notices from
            us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern
            your use of startmydiet.com, and it is your responsibility to review
            them for changes.)
          </p>
          <h5>Children</h5>
          <p>
            startmydiet.com does not sell products for purchase by children. We
            may sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are
            under 18, you may use startmydiet.com only with the involvement of a
            parent or guardian.
          </p>
          <h5>Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</h5>
          <p>
            If you choose to visit startmydiet.com, your visit and any dispute
            over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Conditions of Use,
            including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and
            application of the law of the state of Rhode Island. If you have any
            concern about privacy at startmydiet.com, please send us a thorough
            description to via our website, and we will try to resolve it. Our
            business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the
            Conditions of Use will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders
            of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to,
            but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes.
            Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all
            information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind
            the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our
            policies and practices to make them less protective of customer
            information collected in the past without the consent of affected
            customers.

            have been shipped, including addresses and phone number; people
            (with addresses and phone numbers) listed in 1-Click settings;

            Top Sellers; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to,
            through, and from our Web site, including date and time; products
            you viewed or searched for; and the phone number you used to call
