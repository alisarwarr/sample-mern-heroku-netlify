            The failure of startmydiet.com or its affiliates to insist upon

          </p>
          <h5>Privacy and Child Protection Policy</h5>
          <p>
            startmydiet.com cares about the privacy of each user of its Web site
            ("user" or "you"), including those who trust us enough to place
            orders. In order to protect the privacy of its users,
            startmydiet.com has adopted the following policy: I. General
            Information When you use the Web site some basic general information
            is collected. This information is used to improve the Web site and
            make your use of the Web site as enjoyable and efficient as
            possible. This general information is used internally in connection
            with startmydiet.com business, including startmydiet.com personal,
            marketing and advertising efforts. II. Personal Information When you
            set up an account on the Web site or purchase an item from the Web
            site, we collect personal information (which you provide) that may
            include your: (i) first and last name; (ii) billing address; (iii)
            shipping address; (iv) other shipping addresses; (v) email address;
            (vi) phone number; (vii) credit card account number; (viii) items
            purchased from us; and (ix) browsing, buying and selling patterns
            (collectively, "Personal Information"). III. Use/Sharing of Personal
            Information Your name, shipping and billing addresses, and credit
            card number(s) are used by startmydiet.com in order to provide you
            with the goods that you purchase on the Web site. We use your email

            are contactable by our delivery service should delivery difficulties

          </p>
          <h5>Credit Card Security</h5>
          <p>
            The Internet is a vast network of computers. Because the data passes
            from computer to computer, some Internet shoppers worry that
            unauthorized persons may intercept the data and gain access to
            credit card numbers, but shopping on a secure site is actually safer
            than handing a credit card to a waiter in a restaurant. Taking the
            steps below will lower the chances of interception of your credit
            card number: Limit your online shopping to Internet merchants, such
            as startmydiet.com, with sites equipped with Secure Sockets Layer
            (SSL) technology. SSL prevents unauthorized people from intercepting
            your data. Use a browser, such as Netscape Navigator or Internet
            Explorer, which supports SSL. These browsers show a symbol in the
            status bar, such as a key or lock, when you are on a site that uses
